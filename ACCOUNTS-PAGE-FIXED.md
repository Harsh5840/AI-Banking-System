# üéâ Accounts Page Fixed!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Accounts Not Displaying
**Problem:** The accounts list was not showing on the accounts page

**Root Causes:**
1. `setAccounts` line was commented out in `fetchAccounts()` function
2. Missing JSX code to render the accounts list

**Solutions:**
‚úÖ Uncommented `setAccounts(Array.isArray(response.data) ? response.data : response.data.accounts || [])` 
‚úÖ Added complete accounts list rendering with cards
‚úÖ Added proper loading, error, and empty states
‚úÖ Fixed all JSX structure issues
