# 🐛 Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Invalid Date Display
**Problem:** Transactions were showing "Invalid Date" in the frontend

**Root Cause:** 
- Backend was sending `timestamp` field
- Frontend was trying to access `createdAt` field
- Mismatch caused `new Date(undefined)` → "Invalid Date"

**Solution:**
- Updated backend controller to send both `timestamp` AND `createdAt`
- Both now contain the same ISO date string for compatibility

**File Changed:** `backend/src/controllers/transactionController.ts`

---

### 2. 📊 Category Classification Not Working
**Problem:** "Netflix" description was classified as "others" instead of "entertainment"

**Root Cause:** 
- Category classification logic was too basic
- Missing keywords for streaming services
- Limited entertainment keywords

**Solution:**
- **Enhanced classification with 150+ keywords** across 10 categories:
  - ✅ Entertainment (Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, Hulu, YouTube Premium, etc.)
  - ✅ Food & Dining (Restaurants, cafes, Starbucks, McDonald's, etc.)
  - ✅ Transportation (Uber, Lyft, gas, parking, etc.)
  - ✅ Shopping (Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Target, etc.)
  - ✅ Utilities (Electric, water, internet, rent, etc.)
  - ✅ Healthcare (Medical, pharmacy, hospital, etc.)
  - ✅ Education (School, courses, Udemy, Coursera, etc.)
  - ✅ Fitness (Gym, yoga, sports, etc.)
  - ✅ Travel (Hotels, Airbnb, flights, etc.)
  - ✅ Others (Default fallback)

**File Changed:** `backend/src/ai/fraud.ts`

---

### 3. 📝 Description Not Being Saved
**Problem:** Transaction descriptions weren't being stored in the database

**Root Cause:** 
- Description field wasn't included in the transaction creation data
- Ledger entries also didn't store descriptions

**Solution:**
- Added `description` field to transaction data
- Added `description` field to both debit and credit ledger entries
- Now descriptions are properly persisted and displayed

**File Changed:** `backend/src/db/transaction.ts`

---

### 4. 🏷️ Transaction Type Missing
**Problem:** Frontend couldn't determine if transaction was income/expense/transfer

**Solution:**
- Added `type` field to transaction response
- Logic determines type based on:
  - `category === 'transfer'` → transfer
  - `amount > 0` → income
  - `amount < 0` → expense
- Amount is now always returned as positive (abs value)
- Type field tells you the direction

**File Changed:** `backend/src/controllers/transactionController.ts`

## Testing

### Test Classification
To test the enhanced category classification:

```bash
# Create a Netflix subscription
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/transactions/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "expense",
    "from": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID",
    "amount": 15.99,
    "description": "Netflix subscription"
  }'

# Expected: Category should be "entertainment" ✅
```

### Test Description Saving
```bash
# Check backend logs - you should see:
📊 Classified expense "Netflix subscription" as: entertainment
```

### Test Date Display
- Transactions should now show proper dates instead of "Invalid Date"
- Format: `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS`
